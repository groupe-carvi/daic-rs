/// Trait that all device nodes must implement to be created via `Pipeline::create<T>()`
/// 
/// # Overview
/// 
/// This trait is analogous to the C++ `DeviceNodeCRTP` pattern used in depthai-core,
/// allowing generic node creation in the pipeline using a type-safe, Rust-idiomatic approach.
/// 
/// In the C++ library, nodes are created using `pipeline.create<dai::node::Camera>()` where
/// the node type is a template parameter. This trait provides the same ergonomic API in Rust.
/// 
/// # Design Pattern
/// 
/// The trait uses the "type-driven instantiation" pattern where:
/// - The pipeline holds the context for node creation
/// - Node types implement this trait to define their creation logic
/// - The generic `Pipeline::create::<T>()` method dispatches to the trait implementation
/// 
/// # Example
/// 
/// ```ignore
/// use daic_rs::pipeline::Pipeline;
/// use daic_rs::camera::CameraNode;
/// use daic_rs::pipeline::DeviceNode;
/// 
/// let pipeline = Pipeline::new()?;
/// 
/// // For nodes that don't need parameters, use DeviceNode trait
/// // (future nodes like StereoDepth, RGBD would implement this)
/// // let stereo = pipeline.create::<StereoDepthNode>()?;
/// ```
/// 
/// # Implementation Notes
/// 
/// - For nodes that don't require parameters, implement this trait
/// - For nodes that require parameters (like `CameraNode`), use `DeviceNodeWithParams` instead
/// - The `Sized` bound ensures the node can be returned by value
/// Low-level (FFI) extension trait.
///
/// Prefer implementing `CreateInPipeline` / `CreateInPipelineWith` instead.
///
/// # Safety
/// Implementors must uphold the FFI contract:
/// - Any handles returned must belong to the provided `Pipeline`
/// - Returned Rust values must keep the underlying pipeline alive as long as needed
/// - Do not mix handles from different pipelines
pub unsafe trait DeviceNode: Sized {
    /// Create a new instance of this device node within the given pipeline
    /// 
    /// This method is called by `Pipeline::create<T>()` to instantiate the node.

    /// 1. Call the appropriate C API function to create the node
    /// 2. Handle any errors from the C layer
    /// 3. Return a properly initialized Rust wrapper

    /// # Arguments
    /// 
    /// * `pipeline` - The pipeline in which to create this node

/// Trait for device nodes that require additional parameters for creation
/// 
/// # Overview
/// 
/// Some device nodes need additional configuration at creation time. For example,
/// `CameraNode` requires a `CameraBoardSocket` to specify which physical camera to use.
/// 
/// This trait extends the basic `DeviceNode` pattern to support parameterized creation,
/// maintaining the ergonomic generic API while allowing flexibility.
/// 
/// # Example
/// 
/// ```ignore
/// use daic_rs::pipeline::Pipeline;
/// use daic_rs::camera::CameraNode;
/// use daic_rs::common::CameraBoardSocket;
/// use daic_rs::pipeline::DeviceNodeWithParams;
/// 
/// let pipeline = Pipeline::new()?;
/// 
/// // Camera nodes need a socket parameter
/// let camera = pipeline.create_with::<CameraNode, _>(CameraBoardSocket::CamA)?;
/// ```
/// 
/// # Type Parameters
/// 
/// * `P` - The parameter type required for node creation
/// 
/// # Implementation Notes
/// 
/// - Use this trait when your node requires configuration at creation time
/// - The parameter type `P` can be any type that makes sense for your node
/// - For nodes without parameters, implement `DeviceNode` instead
/// Low-level (FFI) parameterized extension trait.
///
/// Prefer implementing `CreateInPipelineWith<P>` instead.
///
/// # Safety
/// Same safety requirements as `DeviceNode`, plus the implementor must correctly interpret `params`.
