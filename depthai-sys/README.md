# depthai-sys

Low-level FFI crate for **depthai-rs**.

This crate is responsible for building/downloading **Luxonis DepthAI-Core v3** and generating Rust bindings (via `autocxx`) plus a small C++ wrapper layer.

Most users should depend on the high-level crate instead:

- High-level crate: `depthai`
